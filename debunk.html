			<h1>Debunking Anti-Israel Myths</h1>
			<h2>Israel's creation was not fair to the Arabs?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>First, some relevant history: In 1947, the United Nations partitioned Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.</li>
				<li>In Palestine, right before the split, about 7% of the population was Jewish. However, 78% of Palestinian land was allocated to the Jews. The numbers don't add up until you factor in that a clear majority of people living in that 78% were Jewish.</li>
				<li>In the original outline mandated by the League of Nations (the predecessor to the U.N.), the "Jewish National Home" included what is now Jordan, meaning that the Jews only received 17.5% of the original designation. It did not include Jerusalem, and the majority of their land was arid desert, but they accepted the proposition, unlike the Arabs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Israelis stole Arab farmland?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When the U.N. created Israel, 190,000 acres of farmland belonged to Arabs, while only 4,000 acres belonged to Jews.</li>
				<li>The average price of arid farmland for Israelis buying from Arabs was $1000 per acre, while rich, arable land in Iowa was $110 per acre.</li>
				<li><blockquote>Arabs are as prodigal in selling their land as they are in&hellip;weeping[ about it].</blockquote><cite>&ndash; King Abdullah I of Jordan</cite></li>
				<li>Thousands upon thousands of Arabs left their homes for the ensuing war, but not because of Israelis forcing them out. They either left voluntarily to get out of the war zone, or they left under pressure from their Arab leaders.</li>
				<li><blockquote>Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homes. But we ouserlves are the ones who encouraged them to leave.</blockquote><cite>&ndash; Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm of Syria</cite></li>
