			<h1>Debunking Anti-Israel Myths</h1>
			<h2>Israel's creation was not fair to the Arabs?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>First, some relevant history: In 1947, the United Nations partitioned Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.</li>
				<li>In Palestine, right before the split, about 7% of the population was Jewish. However, 78% of Palestinian land was allocated to the Jews. The numbers don't add up until you factor in that a clear majority of people living in that 78% were Jewish.</li>
				<li>In the original outline mandated by the League of Nations (the predecessor to the U.N.), the "Jewish National Home" included what is now Jordan, meaning that the Jews only received 17.5% of the original designation. It did not include Jerusalem, and the majority of their land was arid desert, but they accepted the proposition, unlike the Arabs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Israelis stole Arab farmland?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When the U.N. created Israel, 190,000 acres of farmland belonged to Arabs, while only 4,000 acres belonged to Jews.</li>
				<li>The average price of arid farmland for Israelis buying from Arabs was $1000 per acre, while rich, arable land in Iowa was $110 per acre.</li>
				<li><blockquote>Arabs are as prodigal in selling their land as they are in&hellip;weeping[ about it].</blockquote><cite>&ndash; King Abdullah I of Jordan</cite></li>
				<li>Thousands upon thousands of Arabs left their homes for the ensuing war, but not because of Israelis forcing them out. They either left voluntarily to get out of the war zone, or they left under pressure from their Arab leaders.</li>
				<li><blockquote>Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homes. But we ouserlves are the ones who encouraged them to leave.</blockquote><cite>&ndash; Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm of Syria</cite></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Israel currently treats Palestinians terribly?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The commonly criticised wall between West Bank and Israel has almost eliminated suicide bombings, which used to be a weekly occurrance.</li>
				<li>Israel is always in the hot seat for so-called oppression of the Palestinians, but there are less-known peoples being oppressed right now such as Tibet by China, Kashmir by India, and Cyprus by Turkey.</li>
				<li>Israel is the only true liberal democracy in the Middle East: Just like here, all citizens enjoy:
					<ul>
						<li>Freedom of Speech</li>
						<li>Freedom of Press</li>
						<li>Freedom of Assembly</li>
						<li>Freedom of Religion</li>
						<li>Egalitarianism</li>
						<li>Recognition of homosexuality</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Palestinians are free to take advantage of all these privileges, but some don't. However, the 1.3 million Arabs who live in Israel are the healthiest, best educated, and best fed Arabs in the Middle East.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Israel is committing apartheid?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The South African apartheid this accusation is based on was about race. However, Arabs, Jews, and anyone else can vote, sue, or be elected.</li>
				<li><blockquote>At only 20% of the population, would Arabs even be eligible for election if they squirmed under the thumb of apartheid? Would an apartheid state extend voting rights to women and the poor in local elections, which Israel did for the first time in the history of Palestinian Arabs?</blockquote><cite>&ndash; Irshad Manji</cite></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Israel is perpetrating brutality in Gaza?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Gaza War started because thousands of rockets fired at Israel from Gaza.</li>
				<li>Gazan citizens built tunnels into Israel to launch attacks from. They were discovered by complete luck by the Israeli Defense Force.</li>
				<li>Israel goes out of its way to warn Gazans about incoming rockets.</li>
				<li>If Palestinian children or civilians were too close to an intended strike, the I.D.F. would use a drone to cancel the strike. The only reasons civilians would be killed were if Hamas put missiles and weapons in homes, schools, and hospitals, using them as human shields.</li>
				<li><blockquote>Here's the difference between us. We're using missile defense to protect our civilians, and they're using their civilians to protect their missles.</blockquote><cite>&ndash; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel</cite></li>
